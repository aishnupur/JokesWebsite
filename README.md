# JokesWebsite

We developed a social networking website using JSP, Servlet and MySQL about Jokes where you as a user need to make an account on this website, and login with valid credentials. After you login you will be redirected to the home page, where you get an option to insert a new joke or see the list of all the jokes or you can also search jokes based on tags.
If you list the jokes, you will see the title, description, tags and the username who posted this joke. You can add this username to your favorite friends list, so that you can see the jokes posted by him/her. You can also delete this friend of yours from the favorite friends list or browse the profile of your friend. You can also add the joke you like to the favorite jokes list and delete this joke from the favorite jokes list whenever you want.
There is an option to review the joke where in you can select the score from the dropdown and write comments for the corresponding joke.
Also, If you give the tags in the search bar, you can fetch all the jokes which have those tags.
